0.07  2013-06-08
      - expose a 'step' method to run single iterations of the repl
      - plugins specified in the 'plugins' constructor parameter are now run
        after loading config rather than before (this should give them more
        control over what actually runs - if this is a problem, i might add
        separate options for "before config" and "after config")
      - config handling is split out into a separate Reply::Config class for
        better reuse of the config loading logic
      - DataDumper plugin now sets Terse and Sortkeys, since that produces
        output that looks better
      - plugins can now set multiple independent lexical environments, to allow
        them to override the actual logical environment without wiping out
        special vars set by other plugins
